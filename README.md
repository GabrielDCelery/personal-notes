# What is this?

My **second brain**. I tried many methods, but PARA was the one that finally "clicked" and became part of my regular workflow.

There a great [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8) video that introduced me to the concept, but there is also this article [PARA guide](https://medium.com/practice-in-public/mastering-the-para-method-and-how-to-take-it-to-new-heights-d48afa1d13b0).

## What is PARA?

PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) is a folder organization method focused on **actionability**. It's the spiritual successor to GTD (Getting Things Done), designed to make knowledge work more actionable by organizing information based on how frequently you need to act on it.

## The Four Categories

### 01. Projects

**"A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline."**

Short-term efforts with specific outcomes and end dates.

**Examples:**

- Write a research report
- Develop a new product feature
- Renovate the apartment
- Finish German language course

**Review frequency:** Weekly or more

---

### 02. Areas of Responsibility

**"A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time."**

Ongoing responsibilities that require sustained attention but have no end date.

**Examples:**

| Work                | Personal |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Accounting          | Health   |
| Product Development | Finances |
| Marketing           | Family   |
|                     | Writing  |
|                     | Travel   |
|                     | Hobbies  |

**Review frequency:** Monthly

---

### 03. Resources

**"A topic or theme of ongoing interest."**

Reference material on subjects you're learning about or interested in.

**Examples:**

- Personal productivity
- Coding
- Economics
- German language

**Review frequency:** Only when taking action on that topic

---

### 04. Archives

**"Inactive items from the other three categories."**

Completed or inactive items saved for future reference.

**Examples:**

- Completed or paused projects
- Former areas of responsibility
- Topics no longer of interest

**Review frequency:** None (reference only)

## Core Principles

### Actionability Over Topics

Information is sorted by **how actionable it is**, not by topic. This determines review frequency and keeps you focused on what matters now.

### The Pareto Principle Applied

Separating Projects from Areas distinguishes activities that **generate outcomes** (Projects) from activities that **maintain standards** (Areas).

### Clear Boundaries

| Category  | Definition       | Has Deadline? | Has Standard? |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Projects  | Short-term goals | Yes           | No            |
| Areas     | Ongoing roles    | No            | Yes           |
| Resources | Interests        | No            | No            |
| Archives  | Inactive items   | N/A           | N/A           |

**Key distinction:** Areas are roles you **take on** (with responsibility), while Resources are topics you're **interested in** (without obligation).

## Information Flow

Information moves down the hierarchy as its actionability changes:

```
Projects
    ↓ (project completed but role continues)
Areas
    ↓ (valuable reference material generated)
Resources
    ↓ (no longer active or relevant)
Archives
```

**Example flow:**

1. Project: "Develop new product feature" (active work)
2. → Area: "Product Development" (becomes ongoing responsibility)
3. → Resource: Technical documentation (reference material)
4. → Archive: Old product specs (inactive but preserved)

## Folder Structure

```
/
├── 01_projects/
│   ├── project-name-1/
│   ├── project-name-2/
│   └── ...
├── 02_areas/
│   ├── area-name-1/
│   ├── area-name-2/
│   └── ...
├── 03_resources/
│   ├── topic-name-1/
│   ├── topic-name-2/
│   └── ...
└── 04_archives/
    ├── archived-item-1/
    ├── archived-item-2/
    └── ...
```

## Usage Guide

### Starting a New Project

1. Create a folder in `01_projects/`
2. Define the goal and deadline
3. Link it to a related Area if applicable

### Maintaining Areas

1. Identify your key responsibilities
2. Create a folder for each in `02_areas/`
3. Review monthly to ensure standards are met

### Building Resources

1. Save reference material in `03_resources/`
2. Organize by topic, not by source
3. Only access when actively working on that topic

### Archiving

Move items to `04_archives/` when:

- A project is completed or paused
- An area is no longer your responsibility
- A resource no longer interests you

**Do not delete** - keep for future reference.

## Review Schedule

| Folder    | Frequency | Purpose                         |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Projects  | Weekly+   | Track progress toward goals     |
| Areas     | Monthly   | Ensure standards are maintained |
| Resources | As needed | Access when taking action       |
| Archives  | Never     | Reference only                  |

## Common Patterns

### Project-Area Relationship

Most Projects relate to an Area:

- **Area:** Product Development
  - **Project:** Develop new product feature
  - **Project:** Fix critical bug in payment system

### Resource-Project Pipeline

Resources become actionable when they inspire Projects:

- **Resource:** Personal productivity methods
  - **Project:** Implement weekly review system

### Lifecycle Management

```
Active Project → Completed → Move to Archives
Active Area → No longer responsible → Move to Archives
Resource → No longer interested → Move to Archives
```
