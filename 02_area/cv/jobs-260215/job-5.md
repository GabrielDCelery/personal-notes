Description
nSure.ai is the payment fraud prevention provider of choice for Gaming, Prepaid and Gift Cards, and Crypto. We offer a managed service based on adaptive AI that deploys, for each customer, a dedicated model trained on their data. Focusing on behavioral patterns - the most accurate and uniquely effective way to mitigate modern scalable fraud - our solution takes a fundamentally different approach to detecting fraud and preventing it from happening. Our customers benefit from the highest-efficacy decisions delivered in real-time, with up to 98% approval rates and a chargeback guarantee, generating zero-risk net incremental profit.

We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to join our core team and push forward the technology that powers our fraud prevention engine. In this role, you’ll work closely with Data Analysts and Data Scientists to evolve the logic, infrastructure, and performance of our decision-making systems.

You’ll design and build high-performance backend services, improve latency and reliability at scale, and contribute to the architecture of a distributed microservices ecosystem running in Kubernetes. This is an opportunity to make a direct impact on our product, performance, and customers in a fast-moving startup environment where ownership, initiative, and curiosity truly matter.
