DevOps Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer -£35,000 to £100,000 per annum - SC or DV clearance required

Two roles available, each based in either Woking or Hampshire, with hybrid working (two days per week on site)

We are hiring two DevOps and Site Reliability Engineers to join a highly technical consultancy working in the secure sector. Either role can be based in Woking or Hampshire. The hybrid arrangement is two days per week in the office, with the remaining time from home.

There are two positions. One will support a live MoD account. The other will focus on internal systems and platform capability.

Both roles are open to people at any stage of their career. We do not want salary expectations to be a blocker, so we're happy to have a straightforward conversation early and agree an appropriate figure before submission.

This consultancy places real emphasis on long-term research, engineering quality and innovation. While there is always an element of delivery, the work is structured to allow time for improving platforms, introducing automation and doing things properly rather than simply keeping systems running.

You will work directly with the Head of Software, who is highly experienced and enthusiastic about automation and modern engineering practices. There is genuine scope to influence technical direction and ways of working.

This is secure-sector work and SC or DV clearance is required. Existing clearance is strongly preferred. In some cases, sponsorship may be possible where eligibility and role fit are clear.

We're looking for engineers who dislike repetitive manual work, take ownership of reliability and operations, and make the case for better, more automated ways of working. If you enjoy improving platforms, reducing friction and making systems more robust over time, you'll fit well.

Experience with some of the following would be useful, but you don't need all of them: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, GitLab and CI/CD pipelines, Python, Java and Spring, JavaScript and React, and any major cloud platform.

Reasonable Adjustments:

Respect and equality are core values to us. We are proud of the diverse and inclusive community we have built, and we welcome applications from people of all backgrounds and perspectives. Our success is driven by our people, united by the spirit of partnership to deliver the best resourcing solutions for our clients.
