# The problem

Wanted to have some refresher around the difference between `CommonJS` and `NodeJS`.

# The history

## Originally Javascript was working in the browser only

Javascript in the browser was imported using the `script` tag and there was no module system so variables were shared globally. These were called using the `EX` naming convention, e.g. `ES3 (1999-2009)`, `ES5 (2009-2015)`.

```txt
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="utils.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

```js
// utils.js
var myUtils = {
  add: function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
};

// app.js
// Just access the global variable
console.log(myUtils.add(1, 2));
```

## 2009 - Node.js was created

It needed something immediately so we got CommonJS that was using the `require` syntax. It was simple and it just worked.

People tried to make CommonJS work in the browsers using tools like `Browserify` and `Webpack` that parsed commonjs code into bundles that would work in the browser, and it worked-ish but was still far from ideal.

## 2015 - ES modules became the official standard

`ES6` marked a milestone in unifying the browser and backend. Since it was released in `2015` people also refer to it as `ES2015`.

After becoming the standard `browsers` started supporting it around `2017`.

```txt
<script src="old-library.js"></script> <!-- Regular script, still using global scope -->
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script> <!-- ES6 module -->
```

`NodeJS` also started using it with the experimental flags first. Then starting with `nodejs 14` in the `package.json` you had to set the `"type": "module"` filed to tell nodejs how to interpret the `js` files (or you had to use `.mjs` or `.cjs` extensions) and starting with `nodejs 20` you can use either or without the `package.json` and nodejs will be smart enough to use the proper solution.

The naming convnetion sill follows thie followng standard:

```txt
ES6 = ES2015 (they're the same thing)
ES7 = ES2016
ES8 = ES2017
And so on...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Nobody really says ES7, ES11 etc... anymore, people will say "I am writing ES6" to refer to a modern ESwhatever syntax

# NodeJS version vs ES version

Since ESX is the specificaion for the language's capabilities and Nodejs is a runtime for executing that code NodeJS is constantly evolving but it should be always cheked which version of NodeJs can execute which version of ES specification.

Quick Reference Table:

| ES Version   | Minimum Node.js | Released |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- |
| ES2015 (ES6) | Node.js 6       | 2016     |
| ES2016       | Node.js 7       | 2017     |
| ...          |                 |          |
| ES2023       | Node.js 20      | 2023     |
| ES2024       | Node.js 22      | 2024     |

# Typescript

When transpiling typescript code in the `tsconfig.json` file we have to set the `"target"` (what TO are we compiling) and the `"module"` (what FROM are we compiling) fields. These have a bunch of namings.

## TARGET

This controls what JavaScript features are used in the compiled output:

| Target        | Year      | What you get                                       |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| es3           | 1999      | Ancient, don't use                                 |
| es5           | 2009      | No arrow functions, classes, let/const - super old |
| es6/es2015    | 2015      | Arrow functions, classes, let/const, promises      |
| es2016        | 2016      | + \*\* operator, Array.includes                    |
| es2017        | 2017      | + async/await                                      |
| es2018        | 2018      | + rest/spread for objects                          |
| es2019        | 2019      | + Array.flat, Object.fromEntries                   |
| es2020        | 2020      | + optional chaining ?., nullish coalescing ??      |
| es2021-es2024 | 2021-2024 | Newer features each year                           |
| esnext        | Latest    | Bleeding edge, all latest features                 |

## MODULE

- Module systems you'll actually use

| Module   | What it is                              | When to use                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| commonjs | Node.js legacy (require/module.exports) | Old Node.js projects                         |
| esnext   | ES modules, latest syntax               | Modern projects (browser or Node.js)         |
| nodenext | Follows Node.js rules exactly           | Node.js projects that need dual ESM/CommonJS |

- Module systems you probably won't use

| Module               | What it is                             | When to use                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| none                 | No module system                       | Tiny scripts with no imports                          |
| amd                  | Async Module Definition (RequireJS)    | Legacy browser code, basically dead                   |
| umd                  | Universal Module Definition            | Libraries supporting both AMD and CommonJS - outdated |
| system               | SystemJS loader                        | Very rare, old bundler                                |
| es2015/es2020/es2022 | ES modules with specific syntax limits | Rarely needed, just use esnext                        |
| node16/node18/node20 | Locked to specific Node.js versions    | Use nodenext instead                                  |
| preserve             | Don't transform imports at all         | Bundlers like Bun that handle it themselves           |

### NodeNext vs EsNext

`ESNext` = "I want to speak modern JavaScript"

- Writing code using the newest JavaScript features
- A bundler (like webpack/vite) or browser will understand
- Can skip file extensions: import thing from './file'

`NodeNext` = "I want to speak Node.js's special dialect"

- Node.js has special rules about how files talk to each other
- You MUST say the full filename: import thing from './file.js'
- Node.js needs to know if you're using old-style or new-style imports

#### Real Example

With ESNext:

```typescript
// TypeScript lets you be lazy
import { hello } from "./utils"; // ✅ Works (bundler figures it out)
```

With NodeNext:

```typescript
// Node.js makes you be explicit
import { hello } from "./utils.js"; // ✅ You MUST write .js
import { hello } from "./utils"; // ❌ ERROR! Where's the .js?
```

#### When to use each?

Use ESNext when:

- Making a website (React, Vue, etc.)
- Using a bundler (webpack, vite, rollup)
- "I don't care about Node.js specifically"

Use NodeNext when:

- Making a Node.js server or CLI tool
- Publishing to npm
- "My code will run directly in Node.js"

The simplest rule:

🟢 Building for Node.js? → Use NodeNext
🔵 Building anything else? → Use ESNext

## Additional issues and what lib solves

There is also the added issue of what is it that typescript CAN compile and what is it that it CAN NOT.

1. Syntax features - TypeScript CAN transpile these ✅

Examples:

- Arrow functions (() => {})
- Classes
- Async/await

2. Runtime APIs - TypeScript CANNOT transpile these ❌

Examples:

- Array.includes() (ES2016)
- Object.entries() (ES2017)
- Promise (ES2015)
- Array.flat() (ES2019)

> [!WARN]
> so you will either need a `polyfil` or configure the `lib` property in `tsconfig.json`

```ts
// Without proper lib configuration
const result = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const data = await result.json();

document.getElementById("app")?.innerHTML = "Hello";
```

Issue: Does your environment have fetch? Does it have document? TypeScript needs to know!

### Examples

Browser application

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]
  }
}
```

- ES2020: Standard JavaScript APIs (Promise, Map, Set, etc.)
- DOM: Browser APIs (document, window, HTMLElement)
- DOM.Iterable: Makes DOM collections iterable (NodeList, etc.)

Node.js Application

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022"]
  }
}
```

- No DOM - there's no document or window in Node.js
- TypeScript will error if you try to use document.getElementById()

Modern Node.js with fetch

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "types": ["node"]
  }
}
```

- Node 18+ has fetch built-in, but you may need @types/node for type definitions

Library/Package (no runtime assumed)

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020"]
    // No DOM - works in both browser and Node.js
  }
}
```

## Instead of guessing, use official presets

```sh
  npm install --save-dev @tsconfig/node18

```

```json
// this is for the tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "nodenext"
  }
}
```
