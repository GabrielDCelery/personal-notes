# Git commit

## Rename latest commit

```sh
git commit --amend -m "an updated message"
git push --force-with-lease # this will not override commits that someone else might have pushed in the meantime
```

## Rename old commits

```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~n # this will show an editor and change `pick` to `reword` for the ones you want to modify
git rebase --continue # after modifying continue the rebase
git push --force-with-lease # this will not override commits that someone else might have pushed in the meantime
```
