# OAuth

## What does OAuth do?

OAuth solves the problem of `delegated authorization` which bascially boils down to `how can I let a website that I don't have an account with access my data?`.

## OAuth terminology

| Term                 | What it means                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource owner       | The user who actually owns the data                                                      |
| Client               | The application that wants to get access to the user's data                              |
| Authorization server | The system the user can use the authorize the application to get access                  |
| Resource server      | The system that stores the user's data                                                   |
| Authorization grant  | This is a credential representing the user's content that the client can access the data |
| Access token         | The actual token the client will use to ask the resource server for the data             |

## OAuth flow

The `resource owner` goes to the `client` website and gets redirected to the `authorization server`. During that process it is already sending some information to the autohorization server, like `what type of grant` we want to get and the `redirect url` we are expecting the resource owner to be sent once they gave us their access.

On the authorization server `provides its credentials` (e.g. username, password) then gets prompted to approve access to the resources the client is seeking.

Once the resource owner `authenticated themselves` and `gave permission` they `again get redirected to the resouce owner's callback URL` (something that was already set up to process the redirect) with an authorization code.

That `authorization code` and `pre-defined client secret` (that was set up with the authorization server) is used in a combined manner to get an `access token` and a `refresh token` that can be used to finally get access to the resource server's data.

## What data can the client access?

The `authorization server` has a list of items called `scopes` that it understands (e.g. email.read, email.delete etc...). The `client` can request one or more of those scopes then the `resource owner` can decide whether they want to allow the client to have access to that or not.

In the initial redirect when the `resource owner` gets sent to the `authorization server` alongide the parameters the `client` sends the `scopes` to which it wants to have access to. And the `access token` that comes out of the whole flow will be scoped to those particular accesses.

## Example flow

1. When the OAuth flow begins the `client` redirects the `resource owner` to the `authorization server` and sends them to a url that looks something like this:

```sh
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
	client_id=abc123&
	redirect_uri=https://yelp.com/callback&
	scope=profile&
	response_type=code&
	state=foobar
```

2. After the `resource owner` logs in and approves access to the scope they are redirected back to the client (either success or error).

```sh
# Error
https://yelp.com/callback?
	error=access_denied&
	error_description=Somethingwentwrong

# Success
https://yelp.com/callback?
	code=saCVAS4351423&
	state=foobar
```

3. Then on a `back channel` the `client` exchanges the code for an authorization token.

```sh
POST www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

code=saCVAS4351423&
client_id=abc123&
client_secret=secret123&
grant_type=authorization_code
```

4. Then the `authorization server` returns an access token (and optionally a refresh token).

```json
{
  "access_token": "fhasfh93774yr8fyuhjklhfle",
  "refresh_token": "1234jkhfnp987yfcv329hfsdaj",
  "expires_in": 3920,
  "token_type": "Beared"
}
```

5. And finally the `client` uses the access token to access actual resources.

```sh
GET api.google.com/some/resource
Authorization: Bearer fhasfh93774yr8fyuhjklhfle
```

## Client setting up itself as a "client" with the auth server

Before the auth flow in order to set up things like the `client secret` the `client` needs to go to the `authorization server` and set itself up as a client.

# OpenID Connect

## The history behind OpenID

The problem with `OAuth` is that it was never designed for `authentication` but for `authorization`. The `access token` was scoped to give access to resources specified in the scope but was not desitned to tell the client `who the resource owner really is`.

In the past companies were building their `custom hacks on top of OAuth` to get the user's information.

## How does OpenID work?

OpenID is just a thin layer on top of OAuth. All it does is when the `client` is exchanging the `authorization code` for an `access token` then on top of that the client also recieves an `identity token` that `can be used to retrieve information about the resource owner`.

The `ID token` looks something like this:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://accounts.google.com", # issuer - identifies who created and signed the token
  "sub": "you@gmail.com", # subject - the unique identifier for the user
  "name": "John Wick", # name - the user's display name
  "aud": "sajh231", # audience - identifies the intended recipient of the token
  "exp": 1311281970, # expiration time - Unix timestamp of when the token expires
  "iat": 1311280970, # issues at - Unix timestamp of when the token was issued
  "auth_time": 1311280969 # auth time - Unix timestamp of when the user was authenticated
}
```

## What if the information we get back via the ID token is not enough?

In OpenID Connect we also get access to a `userinfo endpoint` that we can call with the `access token` to get further information from the user.

```sh
GET www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/userinfo
Authorizaton: Bearer fa41rfref
```

Which will return something like this:

```json
{
  "sub": "you@gmail.com",
  "name": "John Wick",
  "profile_picture": "http://some-url/with/a/picure.jpg"
}
```
