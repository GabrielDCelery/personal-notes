# Git reset

Git reset "walks back" the commit tree and like peeling back an onion resets the tree to a previous hash.

[!WARNING] Git reset is a destructive operation

```sh
git reset HEAD~1 # when you want to specify the number of layers you want to peel back
git reset <hash> # when you want to reset to a specific hash
```

## Soft reset

Soft reset resets the commit history to a previous stage, but all the changes go back to the working tree/index.

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

## Hard reset

Hard reset nukes the commits and only the untracked files stay in the repo (e.g. you added a new file) but the changes are also removed from the working tree/index.

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
