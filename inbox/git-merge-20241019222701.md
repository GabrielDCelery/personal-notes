# Git merge

Merging in git is a non-destructive operation that does not modify the sha and applies the commits based on the time they were committed on top of each other. 

Below we have two divergent branches, `master` and `development`. The common ancestor is `M2`.

```sh
* 0ada496 (HEAD -> master) M4
* 10326d4 M3
* 9e55c06 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```

```sh
* 37fff40 (HEAD -> development) D2
* c0b91bf D1
* 9e55c06 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```

Once merged the `git lot --oneline --decorate` command shows how the changes were committed on top of each other.

```sh
da6e4d1 (head -> master) merge branch 'development'
0ada496 m4
37fff40 (development) d2
c0b91bf d1
10326d4 m3
9e55c06 m2
53e07b3 m1
```

And with the graph view when using `git lot --oneline --graph --parent --decorate`

```sh
*   da6e4d1 0ada496 37fff40 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'development'
|\  
| * 37fff40 c0b91bf (development) D2
| * c0b91bf 9e55c06 D1
* | 0ada496 10326d4 M4
* | 10326d4 9e55c06 M3
|/  
* 9e55c06 53e07b3 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```
