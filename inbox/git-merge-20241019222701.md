# Git merge

```sh
git merge <the_branch_you_want_to_merge_onto_the_branch_you_are_currently_on>
```

## How does git resolve merges if there are not conflicts

Merging in git is a non-destructive operation that does not modify the sha and applies the commits based on the time they were committed on top of each other. 

Below we have two divergent branches, `master` and `development`. The common ancestor is `M2`.

```sh
* 0ada496 (HEAD -> master) M4
* 10326d4 M3
* 9e55c06 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```

```sh
* 37fff40 (HEAD -> development) D2
* c0b91bf D1
* 9e55c06 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```

Once merged the `git lot --oneline --decorate` command shows how the changes were committed on top of each other.

```sh
da6e4d1 (head -> master) merge branch 'development'
0ada496 m4
37fff40 (development) d2
c0b91bf d1
10326d4 m3
9e55c06 m2
53e07b3 m1
```

And with the graph view when using `git lot --oneline --graph --parent --decorate`

```sh
*   da6e4d1 0ada496 37fff40 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'development'
|\  
| * 37fff40 c0b91bf (development) D2
| * c0b91bf 9e55c06 D1
* | 0ada496 10326d4 M4
* | 10326d4 9e55c06 M3
|/  
* 9e55c06 53e07b3 M2
* 53e07b3 M1
```

## How does git resolve merges if there are conflicts

Let's assume `M1` and `D1` modified `M0` thus creating a conflict

```sh
* 5007396 (HEAD -> master) M1
* 86db85e M0
```

```sh
* d0f805b (HEAD -> development) D2
* 8524b53 D1
* 86db85e M0
```

After merging git will present us with a request to resolve the conflict.

```sh
git merge development
git status

On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
	new file:   D2

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   M0
```

After resolving the conflict the commits get applied in order as if there were no conflicts, the timeline is retained and there will be an extra commit that also contains the conflict resolution.

```sh
07a6b6f (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'development'
d0f805b (development) D2
5007396 M1
8524b53 D1
86db85e M0
```

```sh
*   07a6b6f (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'development'
|\  
| * d0f805b (development) D2
| * 8524b53 D1
* | 5007396 M1
|/  
* 86db85e M0
```
