# What is a fully qualified domain name

A fully qualified domain name is a `complete domain` that `specifies the exact location` of a device or a resource.

`www.example.com` is a fully qualified domain.

- `www` - is the hostname
- `example` - is the domain name
- `com` - is the top level domain name
