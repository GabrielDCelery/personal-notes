# Git rebase

## Squash multiple commits into one

```sh
git rebase --interactive HEAD~3 # squash the last three commits
```

## Edit specific commit

```sh
git rebase --interactive <commithash>~ # note the tilde ~ at the end of the command, because you need to reapply commits on top of the previous commit of the <commithash>
```

In the default editor, modify pick to edit in the line mentioning <commithash>. Save the file and exit. git will interpret and automatically execute the commands in the file. You will find yourself in the previous situation in which you just had created commit <commithash>.

At this point, <commithash> is your last commit and you can easily amend it.

After changing it commit your changes.

```sh
git commit --all --amend --no-edit
```

- `all` - will stage all the files that have been modified and deleted
- `amend` - amends the last commit and does not create a new commit
- `no-edit` - amends the commit without changing the commit message

```sh
git rebase --continue # finish the rebasing and jump back to the previous HEAD
```

```sh
git push --force-with-lease # pushing the changes to remote
```
