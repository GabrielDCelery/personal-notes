# Linux CLI nmap command

## Scan network for devices

```sh
sudo nmap -sn -n 192.168.1.0/24
```

`nmap` - network exploration tool
`sn` - no port scan (type of the scan)
`n` - disable DNS host resolution
`192.168.1.0/24` - performs a scan on the entire 192.168.1.x subnet

## How to ping targets that seem unresponsive

```sh
nmap -Pn target_ip_or_range
```

Useful when hosts do not respond to `ping probes` and `nmap -A` returned `"Host seems down"`. Tends to happen when trying to scan `firewalled` or `stealthy networks`.
