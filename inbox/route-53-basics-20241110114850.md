# Route 53 basics

## What is Route 53 used for?

It is the service within AWS to `register domains`, to create zone files via `hosted zones` and to provide `managed nameservers`.

It is a `global service`, meaning you don't have to pick a region and the database is replicated accross regions, which means it `can tolerate even regions becoming unavailable`.

It also allows for the creation of `public` and `private` zones. Public zones are available via the internet, private zones have to be associated with a `region` and a  `VPC`.

## How does Route 53 work?

1. Register a domain name
2. Create a hosted zone that creates a zone file and 4 managed nameservers
3. Point the TLD server to the managed nameservers
